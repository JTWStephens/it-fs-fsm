This library can be used whenever a finite state machine (FSM) Java implementation is needed.
It contains classes, interfaces and annotations to represent activities, states (with entering and leaving activities), transitions (with associated activities).
A factory method is provided in order to create a new FSM.

The work is derived from an article on Gabriele Carcassi's blog at http://weblogs.java.net/blog/carcassi/archive/2007/02/finite_state_ma_1.html.
